- 👋 Hi, I’m Amit Raj
- I am a passionate Android Developer 💙 . On the way to becoming a good developer 💜 , I used to take help from articles and online resources to improvise my knowledge.I aim to learn new things daily and make my life easier by designing apps that help people solve their problems. Once I am capable enough to share something with other people, there will surely be a significant demand for it 📝.  


Happy coding…
