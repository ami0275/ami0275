- 👋 Hi, I’m Amit Raj
- I am a passionate Android Developer 💙 . On the way to becoming a good developer 💜, I have taken help from articles and online resources for improvising my knowledge. My aim is to learn new things every day and make my life easier by designing apps that help people solve their problems. Once I feel like I am capable enough to share something with other people then surely there would be a big demand for it 📝. 


Happy coding…
